Privacy Policy
Effective Date: January 18, 2025

Thank you for choosing Live Tennis Signals (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our services.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, address, or email by default. However, we may collect non-personal usage data (e.g., aggregated statistics, device type, OS version) to improve the App’s performance and user experience.

2. How We Use Your Information
Improving the App: We analyze anonymous usage data to identify feature improvements, fix bugs, and understand how users interact with our services.
Customer Support: If you contact us directly (e.g., via email), we may use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry.
3. Third-Party Services
We may integrate third-party services, such as analytics providers, that collect, monitor, and analyze non-personal data. These third parties have their own privacy policies, which govern how they handle your data. We make every effort to use reputable providers that adhere to industry standards for data privacy.

4. Data Sharing & Disclosure
We do not sell or share your personal data with unrelated third parties. We only share aggregated or de-identified information for the purposes of improving the App or complying with legal requirements.

5. Data Retention
Since we do not collect personal data, we only store non-personal, aggregated data (if applicable) for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy.

6. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect any data we handle. Despite our efforts, no electronic transmission or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

7. Children’s Privacy
Live Tennis Signals is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can remove it.
